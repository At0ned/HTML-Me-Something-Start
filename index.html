   <p>Back in August, 2021, my family took a trip down to Gulf Shores, Alabama. It was my first time ever going to the Gulf of Mexico.
      The trip had a little bit of everything.

   Mini golf, a family favorite. I feel like every mini golf course has a pirate theme.

      <h2>Fishing Charter</h2>

     <p> We went on a fishing charter for Spanish and King Mackerel. We went about a mile offshore and anchored down. 
      Within an hour we caught over 20 mackerel. Both of my brothers hooked the same 9 foot tiger shark at different times.
      It wasn't a huge shark, but it managed to pull the boat effortlessly while swimming away. Both of their lines snapped after about
      5 minutes. One of the many reasons I'll never mess with the Ocean.</p>

    <p> After this trip, I realized I wanted to live on the coast eventually. I can't get enough of Gulfs/oceans. I love the fishing, culture,
   and the sound of waves hitting the beach. A beautiful wonder of God's creation. </p>
