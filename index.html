   <p>Back in August, 2021, my family took a trip down to Gulf Shores, Alabama. It was my first time ever going to the Gulf of Mexico. I was kind
      of shocked that Alabama had this. I always imagined it as deep back country.
      The trip had a little bit of everything.

  <p id="golf"> Mini golf, a family favorite. I feel like every mini golf course has a pirate theme. Anyways, this was a really fun and tricky
   course to go through. It had everyone down bad with their scores. My dad is incredible at golf, so he destroyed everyone, all other scores
   would be embarassing to mention

     <p>We went on a fishing charter for Spanish and King Mackerel. We went about a mile offshore and anchored down. 
      Within an hour, we caught over 20 mackerel. These fish fight for a short but hard time. They love to quickly zig zag to break
      the line. But unfortunately for them, we're awesome fishers. Both of my brothers hooked the same 9 foot tiger shark at different times.
      It wasn't a huge shark, but it managed to pull the boat effortlessly while swimming away. Both of their lines snapped after about
      5 minutes. One of the many reasons I'll never mess with the Ocean.</p>

   <h2>Other Activities</h2>
   Paragliding is a common activity out there. You will be hooked up to a parachute-type device and a boat will drive rather fast and
    let you glide in the air. My brother and I went together. I'm not sure how high our altitude was but it was definitely higher than the
    buildings on the beach! <br><br>
    
    We also visited the battlesship USS Alabama. We got to go inside the deck to the crammed engine rooms, to the gunners seats, as well as the
    Captain's deck. I couldn't imagine living on something like that for months on end. Shout out to all the WW2 veterans, y'all are built different.

    <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> After this trip, I realized I wanted to live on the coast eventually. I'm a summer sunshine type of person, I absolutely love the warmth.
   I can't get enough of Gulfs/oceans. I love the fishing, culture,
   and the sound of waves hitting the beach. A beautiful wonder of God's creation. </p>
